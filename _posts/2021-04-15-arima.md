title:  'Econometrics with Numpy: Arima Models'
date:   2021-04-18
---

In this project we'll build an Arima model (mostly) from scratch in Python
using the `numpy` and `scipy` libraries. At the end, we'll have obtained a
Pyton class object capable of estimating Arima models of varying orders as
well as forecasting values into the future.

The data we'll use are the USD/EUR exchange rates spanning from January 2nd
2015 to April 19th 2021, both dates inclusive, sourced from the Federal
Reserve Economic Data (FRED) database. The data can found at
[https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DEXUSEU](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DEXUSEU).
Code fot this project is available on my Github at
[mhoirup/econometrics-python/arima_models.py](https://github.com/mhoirup/econometric-projects/blob/main/econometrics-python/arima-models.py). 

We start off by importing the necessary libraries and sourcing the data:


```python
import datetime
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from pandas_datareader import data
from scipy.optimize import minimize
from scipy.stats import norm

series = data.DataReader('DEXUSEU', 'fred', '2018-01-02')
series.describe().T
#          count      mean       std     min     25%     50%      75%     max
# DEXUSEU  815.0  1.151899  0.043837  1.0682  1.1166  1.1406  1.18285  1.2488

```

## The Theory of Arima Processes

Define the **stochastic process** $\\{y_t:t=-\infty,\ldots,\infty\\}$
indexed by the parameter $t$, which in this case has parameter space
$\mathbb{Z}$. We treat each realisation $y_t$ as a random variable, with
its own range, density and associated moments. Treating $y_t$ this way, we
can the define the unconditional expectation of $y_t$; let $f_{y_t}(y_t)$
denote the density of $y_t$, allowing us to write 

$$
    E(y_t)\equiv \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}y_tf_{y_t}(y_t)dy_t = \mu_t
$$

which provides us with the theoretical justification of the Arima process,
since $E(y_t)$ is what we're actually estimating.

### White Noise Processes

Together with $\\{y_t\\}$, the other main building block of the Arima
process is the **white process** $\\{a_t\\}$, which, for any $t$ and
$\ell$, is defined by

$$
    \begin{gather}
    E(a_t)=E(a_t\mid\Omega_t)=0 \\
    E(a_ta_{t-\ell})=\text{Cov}(a_ta_{t-\ell})=0 \\
    \text{Var}(a_\ell)=\text{Var}(a_t\mid\Omega_t)=\sigma^2_a 
    \end{gather}
$$

where $\Omega_t$ denote the **information set** at time $t$.
