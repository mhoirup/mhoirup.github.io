Welcome to my blog/portfolio where I write about the small projects that I
do in my own time. My writings pertain to statistical analysis, mostly, but
not exclusively, econometrics, as well as to showcase my code and how I go
about the analytical process. There's an emphasis on theory as well, as my
long-term goal is to create something that I revisit if I ever need to
refresh my memory.

Code for all my projects is available at <a href="https://github.com/mhoirup/econometric-projects">
github.com/mhoirup/econometric-projects</a>, which will be entirely in
either R or Python (unless I someday switch over to Julia or something). In
general, I'll try to use R for my analytical projects, while Python is for
building models from the ground up, which I have to be a good exercise in
wrapping my head around the various estimation procedures.
